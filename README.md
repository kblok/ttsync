# TTSync :: Trac-Trello sync tool#

TTsync is an almost bidirectional sync tool between Trac an Trello.

## Data compatibility ##

Trello and Trac do not share the same concepts. This is how TTSync gets them closer
 
Trac|Trelo
------------- | -------------
Project|Board
Ticket|Card
Status|List
Actions|Transtions between lists

From now on this words will be used directly without clarifying if it is from trello or from trac.

## Sycing ##

**One way sync<br/>**
It uses **Trac** as the master repository of tickets. It means that it will create cards for each ticket and it will delete cards if these are not related with any ticket.

**Bidirectional syncing<br/>**
Status syncing is bidirectional. If the status is changed the card will be moved to the right list. If the card is moved from one list to another it will execute de necessary actions in trac in order to change the ticket to the corresponding status.

## Main Dependencies ##
* [trello](https://www.npmjs.org/package/trello): Used to consume the Trello API
* [trac-jsonrpc-client](https://www.npmjs.org/package/trac-jsonrpc-client): Used to consume the Trac API 

Temporarly it uses [another trello module repository](https://github.com/kblok/trello "another repository") until [this pull request](https://github.com/GraemeF/trello/pull/9 "this pull request for the Trello module"), which upgrades [restler](https://www.npmjs.org/package/restler "restler"), is approved 

## Instalation ##
```
npm install ttsync
```

## Usage ##
```javascript
var Ttsync = require('ttsync');
var options = {
//some configuration (see: Configuration)
};

var ttsync = new Ttsync(options);
ttsync.init();
```

## Configuration ##
The options varible should have the needed data to set-up :

1. Trello API consumer
2. Trac API consumer
3. The Trac-Trello connector
4. The Mapping

### Trello configuration ###
The following data is needed to configure the trello API consumer

1. **key and token**: Go to the [trello module help](https://github.com/GraemeF/trello "trello module help") if you need more informati√≥n about how to get this data. 
2. **boardId**: A board's URL has the boardId in it.
3. **callbackUrl**: An URL with which TTSync will create [webhooks in Trello](https://trello.com/docs/gettingstarted/webhooks.html "webhooks in trello").
4. **localCallbackUrlPort**: Port number for the webhook listener.
 

```javascript
var option = {
        trello : {
            key: '',
            token: '',
            boardId: '',
            callbackUrl: '',
			localCallbackUrlPort: 1337
        }
};
```

### Trac configuration ###
The following data is needed to configure the Trac API consumer

1. **server**: Trac server + project name + '/login/jsonrpc'. Ex: 'http://trac/demo.project/login/jsonrpc'
2. **username** and **password**
3. **openTicketsQuery**: Query sent to the trac API. This will be the universe o tickets that will be sent to Trello.

```javascript
var option = {
        trac : {
            server : '<TRAC_SERVER>',
            auth : { username: '<USER_ID>', password: '<PASSWORD>' },
            openTicketsQuery: 'status!=closed'
        }
};
```

### Connector Configuration ###
The way that ticket and a card are linked is not hardcoded in the code. The linking method can be modified or extended.

A ttconnector is a module which implements these methods:

 	- getTicket(ticketId)
    - getCard(cardId)
    - getCardIdFromTicket(ticketId)
    - getCardFromTicket(ticketId)
    - getTicketFromCard(cardId)
    - link(ticket, card)

And this data is needed to configure the connector: 

1. **ttconnector**: Module path
2. **ttconnectorConfig**: Configuration sent to the ttconnector to initialize it. 


```javascript
var option = {
		ttconnector: './custom-field-connector',
        ttconnectorConfig : {
            customFieldId : 'trello_card_id'
        }
};
```

### Mapping ###
Mapping is perhaps the most hard section to configure and requires a deeper analysis.

It has three sections:

1. **userMap**: List of relations between a trelloUser and a tracUser
2. **statusListMap**: List of relations beetween statusFromTrac and listFromTrello
3. **actionsMap**: List which tells TTSync which actions has to be performed in trac when a card changes from one list to another. Each item needs the following data:
	1. **fromList**: List's friendly name where the card was moved from
	2. **toList**: List's friendly name where the card was moved to
	3. **actions**: TTSync is prepared to perform more than one action if it is needed. Each action should have these properties:
		1. **name**: The action name (you can find in the trac.ini)
		2. **operations**: It is a list of fields that it needs to update or that the operation requires (Ex: a change of owner). An operation can have this properties:
			1. **update**: field to update
			2. **setCurrentUser** (optional bool): It will set the current user
			3. **fieldValue** (optional): It will set the **update** field with the value of the **fieldValue** field
			4. **value** (optional): It will set the **update** field with its value 

```javascript
var option = {

        mapping : {
			userMap : [
                { trelloUser: '<TRELLO USER>', tracUser: '<TRAC USER>' }
            ],
            statusListMap : [
                { statusFromTrac: '<TRAC STATUS>', listFromTrello: '<TRELLO STATUS>' },
            ],
            actionsMap : [
                {
                    fromList: '<TRELLO LIST>',
                    toList : '<STATUS TRAC>',
                    actions: [
                        {
                            name: '<TRAC ACTION NAME>',
                            operations: [
                                { update: 'action_accept_reassign_owner', setCurrentUser: true },
                                { update: 'owner', setCurrentUser: true },
                            ]
                        }]
                },
            ]
        }
```

## How it works ##

```javascript
var Ttsync = require('ttsync');
var options = {
//some configuration (see: Configuration)
};

var ttsync = new Ttsync(options);
ttsync.init();
```

When the init method is called. TTSync will do all the tasks needed in order to get the trello board in sync with the trac project. After that a server will be running waiting for:

* POST requests from Trello (in the port configured) with any change in the cards
* POST requests from Trac (in the port configured) but to the **trac** resource, ex: "http://localhost:1337/trac". It will listen to any changes in tickets and will reflect these changes in trello

Trac is able to make post request to TTSync installing a plugin

## Pendings ##

- [ ] Publish the trac plugin which makes a request when a ticket changes
